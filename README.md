# Group Project 3

## Notes on style/syntax set up

1. Airbnb style will be used for this project. key features incl preference for single quote use, 2 space (half tab) indents, etc.
2. ESLint is configured and prettier is configured, but they are **NOT** linked. This throws major errors. ESLint will analyze the JavaScript code for potential issues and enforce coding style rules based on AirBnb (already config). The VSCode Prettier ext will automatically format the code on save to the effect of what is outlined in the .prettierrc file. Changing these files will result in errors - it's a delicate balance!
