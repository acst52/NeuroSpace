## [AirBnb Style](https://airbnb.io/javascript/react/), ESLint & Prettier

**ESLint** This project is set up to use ESLint, which will analyze the JavaScript code for potential issues* & enforce coding style rules based on the configuration it has been provided: Airbnb style guide + React recommended rules.

*ESLint will catch syntax errors, unused vars, incorrect use of JS & JS features etc.*

**Prettier** It is most ideal to use your VSCode extension `Prettier` to automatically format your files upon save. There is already a `.prettierrc` file in the repository that will make sure your Prettier extension follows Airbnb style.

*NOTE that ESLint is configured and prettier is configured, but they are NOT linked. Do not link them!!*
